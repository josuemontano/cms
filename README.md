SpartanCMS
===

One of the best CMS I've found is SilverStripe. But something more flexible was needed, so I wrote this content managment system in python 3.

Much work is still ahead, documentation and some functionality is incomplete, but it works!

Dependencies
===

SpartanCMS is a web application written in Pyramid and uses:

* Pyramid 1.5a2 (obviously)
* Python 3
* SQLAlchemy
* PostgreSQL
* WTForms
* Jinja2

It is included an .htaccess file and a FGCI script as an example of how SpartanCMS can be deployed on the web. To use these on a production enviroment you must install Flup for python 3. I use [flup-py3.3](https://github.com/Pyha/flup-py3.3)
