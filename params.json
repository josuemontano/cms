{"name":"SpartanCMS","tagline":"Another CMS powered by Pyramid Framework","body":"SpartanCMS\r\n===\r\n\r\nOne of the best CMS I've found is [SilverStripe](http://www.silverstripe.org). But something more flexible was needed, so I wrote this content managment system in python.\r\n\r\nMuch work is still ahead, documentation and some functionality is incomplete, but it works! Feel free to contribute.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n===\r\n\r\nSpartanCMS is a web application built with:\r\n\r\n* [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about) and Python 3\r\n* SQLAlchemy\r\n* PostgreSQL (it's the default DBMS)\r\n* WTForms\r\n* Jinja2\r\n* cryptography\r\n* psycopg2 (change it to your DMBS library in case you won't use PostgreSQL)\r\n\r\nIt is included an .htaccess file and a FGCI script as an example of how SpartanCMS can be deployed on the web over an Apache web server. To use these on a production enviroment you must **install Flup for python 3**. I use [flup-py3.3](https://github.com/Pyha/flup-py3.3).\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n===\r\n\r\nThis software can be installed and run as any other Pyramid app. Once you have Python 3 and PostgreSQL installed follow these steps (I assume you have a virtual enviroment installed on your $HOME, called, let us say, *env*):\r\n\r\n* Run PostgreSQL and create a new PostgreSQL database called *demo*\r\n* ``` cd $HOME/env/cms/spartan ```\r\n* ``` ../../bin/python setup.py develop ```\r\n* ``` ../../bin/initialize_spartan_db development.ini ```\r\n* ``` ../../bin/pserve development.ini --reload ```\r\n\r\nTo run the public demo site do:\r\n* ``` cd $HOME/env/cms/public ```\r\n* ``` ../../bin/python setup.py develop ```\r\n* ``` ../../bin/pserve development.ini --reload ```\r\n\r\n**Important:** The public package imports some models from spartan, so make sure spartan is properly installed.\r\n\r\nI'm a big fun of [OpenShift](http://www.openshift.com), it's simply the best PaaS out there, I believe. It is hosting some web pages I made with SpartanCMS. To install this app, and any other Pyramid app, on OpenShift view my project [OpenshiftStarter](http://github.com/josuemontano/OpenshiftStarter).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
