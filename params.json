{"name":"SpartanCMS","tagline":"A Pyramid-based CMS","body":"SpartanCMS\r\n===\r\n\r\nOne of the best CMS I've found is [SilverStripe](http://www.silverstripe.org). But something more flexible was needed, so I wrote this content managment system in python 3.\r\n\r\nMuch work is still ahead, documentation and some functionality is incomplete, but it works! Feel free to contribute.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n===\r\n\r\nSpartanCMS is a web application written in Pyramid and uses:\r\n\r\n* Pyramid 1.5a2 (obviously)\r\n* Python 3\r\n* SQLAlchemy\r\n* PostgreSQL\r\n* WTForms\r\n* Jinja2\r\n\r\nIt is included an .htaccess file and a FGCI script as an example of how SpartanCMS can be deployed on the web over apache. To use these on a production enviroment you must **install Flup for python 3**. I use [flup-py3.3](https://github.com/Pyha/flup-py3.3).\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n===\r\n\r\nThis software can be installed and run as any other Pyramid app. Once you have Python 3 and PostgreSQL installed follow these steps (I assume you have a virtual enviroment installed on your $HOME, called, let us say, *env*):\r\n\r\n* Run PostgreSQL and create a new PostgreSQL database called *demo*\r\n* ``` cd $HOME/env/cms/spartan ```\r\n* ``` ../../bin/python setup.py develop ```\r\n* ``` ../../bin/initialize_spartan_db development.ini ```\r\n* ``` ../../bin/pserve development.ini --reload ```\r\n\r\nTo run the demo site do:\r\n* ``` cd $HOME/env/cms/demo ```\r\n* ``` ../../bin/python setup.py develop ```\r\n* ``` ../../bin/pserve development.ini --reload ```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
